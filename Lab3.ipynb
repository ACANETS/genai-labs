    "# Lab 3 - EECE.4860/5860 at UMass Lowell - Spring 2025\n",
    "\n",
    "This lab is to practice the usage of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) to understand how to enhance a LLM to obtain new knowledge without retraining, and experiment with AI agent using LangChain. EECE.5860 students will also write a new tool for a LangGraph agent. You will run Jupyter notebooks on Intel Tiber AI cloud. \n",
    "\n",
    "## **Note** There are three parts in this lab. Parts 1 and 2 are for all the students. Part 3 is an additional requirement intended for EECE.5860 students only. There are some questions for each part, and you need to answer them in your lab report.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Part 1:   RAG (10 points)\n",
    "\n",
    "Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)  merges the powerful retrieval capabilities of large-scale search systems with the generative strengths of transformer models. In the given “simple_rag.ipynb” notebook, the system first retrieves relevant documents or passages from a corpus in response to a query. These retrieved materials are then combined with the query and input into the language model. This two-stage process allows the model to draw on both external information from the corpus and its internal knowledge, resulting in more accurate and contextually rich responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "First execute the [simple_rag.ipynb](simple_rag.ipynb) notebook to experiment with the RAG process. Choose a few different settings for response customization (e.g., top K), dataset (e.g., chunk size), etc., and compare the responses qualitatively. Then you will need to modify the code to add a different LLM such as *google/gemma-2-2b-it*. Your part 1 of the lab will be graded as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Execute the given implementation successfully. Take screenshots to demonstrate the results (4 points)\n",
    "* Modify the code to add a different LLM model for user to choose (3 points)\n",
    "* Answer the questions related to this implementation. (3 point)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Part 2: AI agent using LangChain APIs (10 points)\n",
    "\n",
    "Complete the notebook [Lab3Part2-langchain-agent.ipynb](Lab3Part2-langchain-agent.ipynb) to experiment with AI agent using LangChain and HuggingFace libraries. Specifically, you will use a LangChain agent to process and respond to user queries through a language model interface. It sets up a conversational agent by integrating LLM with other LangChain tools, enabling the agent to perform tasks such as query and calculation. The notebook includes incomplete code to initialize the agent, configure tools, and interact with the agent via natural language prompts. You will complete the missing code and make it operational. We will grade your part 2 of the lab as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Your use LangChain and HuggingFace APIs to complete the code. (5 points)\n",
    "* Answer the questions related to this notebook. (5 points)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Part 3: Write your own tool for LangGraph based AI agent (5 points)\n",
    "\n",
    "Complete the notebook [Lab3Part3-langgraph-agent.ipynb](Lab3Part3-langgraph-agent.ipynb) to experiment with AI agent using LangGraph and ChatNVIDIA chat model. You will need to write a new RAG tool, and supply it to the agent. You can follow the [simple_rag.ipynb](simple_rag.ipynb) example to implement the tool. \n",
