Exercises and Labs for EECE.4860/5860 Introduction to Generative AI at UMass Lowell

**Exercise**: a standalone, complete implementation that introduces a concept or method, and provides an executable example to demonstrate the concept or method. No code addition or modification is needed.

**Lab**: a standalone but incomplete Jupyter notebook that focuses on a concept discussed in the class. Students are expected to complete the notebook by adding code or modifying parts of the existing code, execute the notebook and analyze the results. A lab report is required as part of the lab submission. Lab grades will be based on the code submission and lab reports.
